Hi! I'm Ngozi.

I've been working as a full stack web developer since graduating from [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/eng/), and I just finished up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com)

Outside of programming, I'm an avid [reader](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/39266582-nwogwugwu?shelf=read&sort=date_added), and I'm learning to play the [koto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koto_(instrument)).
