**Quasiparticles** a kind of particle

- emerge out of complicated interactions between huge numbers of fundamental particles (quarks, photons, electrons)
- can be stable. Two reasons
    1. they emerge at very low temperatures
    2. they only interact with each other weakly
- can have properties like mass and charge
- some physicists think fundamental particles are emergent as well

example: **polarons**

- discovered in 1933
- materialize when many electrons get trapped inside a crystal
- push and pull between electrons "dress" an electron. It acts like a quasiparticle with larger mass
- mixture of matter and light

condensed matter is related

Researchers can create quasiparticles that have a fraction of electron's spin or charge

**a "hole":** the absence of an electron where it should exist

**exciton:** quasiparticle made of an electron and a hole that orbit each other

- photons blend with exitons to form **polaritons**, which behave like liquid light en masse - frictionless, doesn't scatter

**Majorana quasiparticles** hypothesized, half electron and half hole at the same time

- could be used to create supercomputers
- zero energy, zero charge. This could allow them to exist inside of a superconductor

**magnon** - a quasiparticle made from bits of a magnetic field on motion across a material
