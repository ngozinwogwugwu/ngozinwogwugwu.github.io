The civil war started with a coup on July 17-18th, 1936

# 1: Origins

Three crucial factors:

1. There were **extremely uneven levels of development** within Spain
2. the **cultural influence of Catholicism**
3. **Spain's army** had an intolerant political culture in its officer corps

Traditional order was coming under strain

1923: soft military coup by General Miguel Primo de Rivera (had backing of the king)

1930: army opposition brought Primo down

1931: republic was declared peacefully

### Uneven Levels of Development

There was a debate over how Spain should modernize itself economically

The WWI caused social change - economic boom, severe inflation and dislocation

Political parties were illegal in the 1920s, so professional associations became more powerful

- progressive industrial elites (based in Catalan textile sector)
- large landowners in souther half of Spain
    
    It was similar to the American deep south - landless peasants lived like slaves
    
- urban professional sector & industrial workers - wanted political voice
- **CNT: anarcho-syndicalist trade union movement**

### Catholicism

embraced order and hierarchy

church's monopoly on truth was challenged by political liberalism and cultural pluralism

local priests were allies of landowners and souther police - **made rural poor anticlerical**

Catholics didn't like being constrained, but had no tolerance for non-catholics

### Spain's Army

Spain lost its empire in 1898 - deprived the over-large officer corps of any meaningful external role

- powerful myth that civilian politicians had been responsible for the final loss of empire
- disliked metropolitan Spanish society and politics
- took charge of Spain's main military academy at Zaragoza

Spain's military class was becoming increasingly isolated

Junior officers stood to lose a lot of money from the Republican reforms

### Large Southern Landowners

used religious issues to mobilize poor northern smallholders to act against their own interests

### Franco

entered the military academy in 1907 (at the age of 15)

Made his career in the colonial Army of Africa

## **Progressive Republicans in Power**

Coalition of socially progressive Republicans and Socialists

- Republicans wanted social reform: land ownership, education, state-church relations, the army
- Socialists wanted welfare
- The coalition was less effective because of big ideological differences between republicans and socialists

Republican Reforms were designed to increase **economic democracy,** which is a **prerequisite for political democracy**

- **Agrarian reform** intended to create smallholding peasantry in souther Spain. They'd be loyal to repluclicans
- **separation of church and state** - no more subsidy to clergy (alienated many poor priests)
    - unpopular interference with Catholic culture
    - opposition to women's suffrage. Thought women would be influenced by the church
    - **secularization was impolitic, ill thought-out and counterproductive**
- **education** - more money to non-religious primary education
- **army reform** - to bring the army under civilian and constitutional control
    - Tried to close down military academy at Zaragoza, enraging *Africanistas*

These reforms were extremely ambitious

- too many at once
- attempted during a depression
- opposed by Spain's traditional elites (landowners, church, millitary)

Their reforms made them enemies, but never actually went into affect

# 2: Rebellion

The coup began on July 17th, 1936

- started in Spanish North Africa (Morocco)
- spread to mainland Spain the next day (provincial garrison revolts)

one result was the government in Madrid didn't have a functioning army

- trade unions and political parties had to find an army
- used a combination of the (loyal) police and the worker militia
- quelled the urban garrison revolts

Republican/progressive areas tended to be areas where the rebellion didn't take hold

- Catalonia and Valencia stayed Republican throughout the war
- Madrid was the capital of the Republic

No area of Spain was entirely conservative

- people with Republican sympathies in conservative areas had to publicly embrace the rebellion
- often led to betrayals

A week after the initial coup, the rebels got planes from Hitler and Mussolini

- used to transport their troops to Spain

The government didn't have power outside of Madrid

- people used the chaos to settle personal vendettas (post-coup violence and pre-war conflicts)
- lots of violence against the powerful. Priests and monks were killed
- the violence damaged the Republic's credibility abroad when it needed external support

Violence in rebel areas: goal was purification

- local civilian elites declared this
- fascists saw killings as cleansing the community of pollution
- this applied to anyone who benefited from the Republic, whether they were political or not: teachers and intellectuals, "new" women, self-educated workers
- at first, vigilantes killed people. However, these vigilantes usually either had close links to rightist organizations, or they were working with the authorities

This meant that there was killing on both sides, but there was an asymmetry to it: the republicans didn't have the ability to stop the violence. The rebels did, but they chose not to

For rebels, liberal politics were the problem, and the solution was terror

- it undid the Republic's redistribution of social and economic power
- it created a complicity between the rebel authorities and everyone who turned against their friends & family

Home was no longer safe

- people migrated back home after the coup, but their former neighbors killed them

**General Francisco Franco** headed **The Army of Africa**

As the Army of Africa moved through the souther half of Spain, large landowners reclaimed their land. They killed Rural laborers

- This warfare was similar to colonial campaigns agains insubordinate indigenous peoples
- They faced a local civilian population with no real weapons, so they tore through the southern half of Spain
- Spain had used poison gas against people in Morocco

Franco's political belief was that alien political ideas had *occupied* Spain

- "I will save Spain from Marxism whatever the cost" "And if that means shooting half of Spain" "As I said, whatever the cost"

The Catholic Church provided legitimacy to the rebels, so they got very little bad press abroad

The Spanish left cared more about workers' rights than the wrongs of colonization

**General Emilio Mola** nominal leader of the rebellion

# 3: The Republic at War

**Non-Intervention treaty** (August 1936) that Britain and France signed with Germany and Italy

- said they wouldn't deliver war material to Spain
- Britain and France honored it. Germany and Italy didn't
- This gave the rebels a huge advantage over the republic

Why did Britain & France allow this to happen?

- Idea was to prevent Spanish war from escalating into a European conflict
- Also, the British thought that a rebel victory would preserve more capital, which affected British investments
- *Also*, Britain's governing elite had political, personal and financial connections to conservative Spain

Britain and France were screwing the republic over

- They *knew* Germany and Italy were not honoring the treaty, but they didn't do anything about it
- Britain refused the republic's navy the right to review in Gibraltar or Tangier
- France reneged on its initial promise to send war material

Hitler and Mussolini's aid was strategically motivated, although ideology also played apart

The Soviet Union provisioned military aid in **November 1936.** This aid was just in time

- At first, the Soviets backed Non-Intervention
- They thought the Republic would win under these circumstances if the fascists honored the agreement
- The soviets never acknowledged the military assistance

## anti-fascists came to Spain to fight

- **International Brigrades** (about 35,000)
- most were already political exiles
- a quarter of the volunteers were Jewish - were actively anti-fascist
- Example: Canadian volunteers who had fled Finland's nationalist leader around 1918
- The brigades were diverse, which made them antithetical to the fascist ideals of purification
- brigades were used as shock troops and sustained high casualties
- The **Abraham Lincoln Brigade** included 90 black Americans
    - **Oliver Law -** first military commander in US history to lead a nonsegregated unit of troops

Foreign medical volunteers joined too

- developed new types of emergency treatment, like blood transfusion techniques

Women generally weren't recruited to help fight

The European communist movement organized most of the international brigades and lobbied governments to lift non-intervention

- **Comintern (Communist International)**
- **PCF (French Communist Party)**

The Republican military command were hostile to the international brigades

- because reasons

Volunteers weren't prepared for the war

- military discipline
- harsh warfare
- antiquated weaponry

## Conditions in Madrid

the first **air raids** of their kind to happen anywhere in Europe

**War Refugees** first went to Madrid, then Barcelona and Valencia - severe culture shock

The rebel army **besieged** Madrid

## Fascist Help

Hitler and Mussolini recognized rebel Spain in November 1936, provided weaponry and manpower (75,000 troops)

## Internal fighting

The Republic distrusted their professional army officers, and the coup had shattered **army unity**

There were political tensions between **the center and periphery**

the **central Republican government** clashed with the **Basque regional authority**

- **PNV (Basque Nationalist Party)** sought sovereign rights

Before the war, there had already been political rivalries between different groups

- the war intensified them
- clashes between socialists-led trade unions, communists and Catalan communists

### Basque fell in the summer of 1937

this happened just as the republican military was beginning to cohere

- also guerrilla fighters behind enemy lines

## Republic's Propaganda

used **photomontage** as a weapon

- depicted their own soldiers as mechanized and modernist
- the fascists didn't do this because **photomontage was modernist and cosmopolitan**

## Cultural Bolshevism

the Nazis coined this term to describe **avant-garde cultural production**

**degenerate art** - Nazi Germany's term for modern art

- idea that a culture can degenerate like a biological organism was widespread, especially among conservative sectors in Europe

Soviet fashion became popular

- the styles were superficial and had little to do with Marxist-Leninism

## Wartime Madrid

The government tried to centralize power

- local governments and trade unions had gained more power since the war had started

The government re-introduced market forces to the food supply

- this hit the urban poor the hardest. They couldn't afford the black market and they had no contacts in the countryside

**Housing shortage** - 350,000 refugees by the end of 1936 meant a 10% population increase

- extra pressure on housing and food in the poorest inner city areas

**May Days** - period of time where [radicalized workers and the urban poor] staged [social and political protests] in Barcelona

- these caused sectarian political struggles
- Soviet intelligence was involved somehow
- Italian secret police assassinated an Italian anarchist in Barcelona during this time

**Andrue Nin** - leader of Catalan-based dissent party

- Spanish/Catalan communists worked with the Comintern to assassinate hime

**Checas** - illegal prisons, appeared in Republican territory in the aftermath of the military uprising

- political parties, unions and militia established their on detention agencies

It became more common to incorporate women and young people into the war effort

- this was partly due the the increased popularity of the Soviet Union

# 4: Rebel Spain

Francoist Spain was much more ideologically homogeneous

## Franco

People in power died by accident or got executed by the rebels. Also **Franco had control of the Army of Africa** at the beginning of the war

Franco's mission was to "save Spain"

- this shaped his military strategy
- he probably thought he was justified in terrorizing civilians

Franco's military strategy:

- colonize the metropolis
- destroy the "alien" republican culture in the cities
- purify Spain from everything that didn't align with his values

Franco thought that industrial cities caused moral pollution

- The war was more about controlling people than about controlling territory
- Franco was prepared to incur losses among his troops

Franco thought that the Army had an absolute right to impose its will on society

- Thought that military organization was the best way to structure a society

Franco deported Spanish Republicans to Nazi concentration camps in 1940

## Wartime stuff

**Estado Campamental** - "Battlefield state"

- By mobilizing Spain's armies, Franco was achieving the "ideal Spain"

The rebels used a lot of air raides

- they backfired. Caused more hatred than fear

**Falange** - a group

- leader got executed by Republicans

**Blue Division** fought with the German armies on the eastern front (1941)

- old shirt Falangists joined this

**Seccion Femenina (SF)** - women's section of the Falange. An "army" of unmarried, economically independent women

- Urban and provincial middle class women joined this
- Women were mobilized for health and welfare needs
- not used for industrial war work
- valued domesticity and subservience

**Anti-Comintern pact** - (February 1939) agreement between Germany, Japan and Italy

### After the victory

Spaniards had to **denounce** their neighbors to military tribunals

- this happened after Franco's military victory in April 1936

The government took all the wealth and property by passing legislation

### Captured Republican Soldiers

they were often recycled

- especially the ones who had been conscripts in the first place
- after the war, they faced political investigation

**Political commissars** were usually shot

**international brigaders** were usually shot

This meant that Franco was breaking the Geneva Conventions

### Propoganda

Commercial cinema was becoming more popular

- Francoist authorities censored them carefully
- Hollywood productions were an important component of popular cinema

## Help from Germany and Italy

Hitler and Mussolini wanted a fast victory

- They increased their aid for this outcome
- Franco advanced his army slowly and deliberately
- This caused political tension

Franco depended heavily on Italian military hardware

Germany and Italy provided airpower, and Franco needed it 

**Why did this alliance happen?** All three dictators wanted to expand their territories

- they would turn a blind eye to each other's imperial actions
- Nazi Germany was disrupting the international status quo, which meant more opportunities to gain territory
- Spain would disrupt French and English imperial interests, since it was in an important strategic position

There was an ideological divide between Francoists and Nazis over the Catholic church

- Nazis were trying to take society beyond sectarian allegiances

### Passive France and Britain

British government didn't think that a Francoist victory would pose a threat to their interests. They didn't help much

## The Church

the Vatican didn't like the radical aspects of fascism, or its exaltation of the state

- opposed Nazism for its atheistic dimension
- this is why the Vatican publicly condemned Hitler's racism
- This was very bad for Franco

The Vatican attempted to broker peace settlements with Franco

The Vatican established full diplomatic relations in 1938, when a rebel victory seemed imminent

**Spain's Catholic hierarchy** aligned itself with Franco

- shared hostility with rationalism, liberalism, socialism and communism

Franco's government would mix in fascist symbols during ceremonial occasions 

# 5: The Republic besieged

The rebels were way better equipped than the Republic

- Portuguese authorities unloaded German and Italian supplies at their ports
- most of the middle-ranking officers were on Franco's side

Stalin sent materiel to the republic (including planes and tanks)

- This was crucial for their survival

Non-Intervention prevented the Republic from buying war material on its own behalf

- this is a big reason why it needed Soviet help

The Republic also didn't have access to its money

- the outgoing cabinet transferred Spain's gold reserves out of the country right before the war (two weeks after the coup)

Mexico was the only country that helped the Republic as a broker

Eastern European countries (mainly Poland) sold armaments to the Republic

The Republic had to overpay for everything because of Non-Intervention

- Had to pay cash up front (unlike the rebels, which bought everything on credit)

### Delivery was a nightmare

The Soviets made the Republic transport everything they bought

Germans and Italians illegally attacked all ships bound for Republic ports

- They allowed Franco to set up a blockade

### French help

The blockade meant that all military aid had to go over land, through France

The French were afraid of being surrounded by fascists, so they practiced "relaxed Non-Intervention"

- goods could go over the French border to Spain, but this route was unpredictable

### A Fractured Republic

There were "five armies, not one", mainly due to regional groupings

During 1938, the Republican camp had many political divisions

- the more defeats it suffered, the more divisions there were

central Republican versus the regional government of Catalonia

Catalonia had one of the deepest independent political and cultural traditions in Spain. When **Negrin assumed control of the Catalan war industry**, he caused another fracture

### The Fall of Asturias

October 1937 - made it clear that the Republic wouldn't win

- no more coal industry
- no more northern army (200k soldiers)

### Battle of Teruel

winter 1937-8 - made it even more clear that the Republic wouldn't win

- was a diversionary campaign
- that was an especially cold winter
- Republicans captured the city in January, but Franco got it back in a counter offensive
- clear turning point of the war
- Franco captured the city, 15k prisoners and lots of military equipment

### The rebels took Vinaros

The rebels separated Catalonia from the central-south Republican zone

this was *very bad* for the Republic, but Franco diverted troops south to Valencia because he thought that France would have to intervene if he sent troops to Catalonia

- The point was to attack the Republic's human resources as much as possible

### Anglo-Italian agreement

April 1938 Britain signed this right after the rebels took a significant victory

Britain pressured France to close its frontier to Spain

- Italy was still sinking Britain's merchant ships, so this didn't make much sense

### Soviet help

Soviet technical advisors (about 700 of them) helped Spanish commanders and officers

- military engineers, technicians, strategists and experts in irregular warfare

By 1938, Stalin thought that the Republic couldn't win, so he stopped helping in any significant way

- there were foreign volunteers, but they were basically symbolic

The longer the Republic resisted, the longer it distracted Germany, so Stalin did continue to help

## Internal Fracturing

When Negrin did the following, he damaged morale in Catalonia:

- move the Republican government to Barcelona
- assumed direct control of Catalan war industry

Catalonia had the deepest independent political and cultural traditions in Spain

### socialists vs communists

- these were the two mass movements sustaining the war effort
- had rivalies before the war that grew more intense during the war

## Juan Negrin

Republican prime minister, took office in May 1937

- tried to get Non-Intervention lifted
- good at international diplomacy
- Non-Intervention basically ended when Hitler occupied Austria in March 1938, but it was too late by then

### Values

Negrin prioritized Republican morale, tried to strengthen Spain's constitutional order

Designed his wartime measures to reinforce **liberal market-based values**, instead of collectivist or anti-capitalist values

Wanted to **normalize the Catholic Church**, even though he was a secular rationalist

- wanted to reintroduce public worship

The communist ideology did not appeal to him

### Actions Aborad

Britain and France were afraid of the conflict extending to the rest of Europe, so **they opposed Negrin's bid to have Non-Intervention lifted** at the league of Nations

Negrin made a number of trips abroad in 1938 to meet with fascists

- he wanted to prevent reprisals and guarantee the integrity of Spain

### Politics at home

Negrin was starting to rely on the communists more than on his own party, which caused problems

- He needed the communists because of their **commitment to a policy of resistance**

## Downfall

By spring 1938, the Republic couldn't serve its civilian population effectively

### Catalonia Isolated

Communication between Catalonia and the central zone was hazardous

It was difficult to travel there, since the rebels controlled sea and air between the two zones

- rebels torpedoed sea traffic

Food had to come from France, but there wasn't enough food coming across the border. Also, whether it came at all depended on politics

### Militarization

The Republican zone was militarizing under the pressure of war, which backfired

- conscription was becoming more aggressive, which made communities resentful
- soldiers were living off the land, which increased social tension

### The fifth column

All major Republican cities had organized networks of spies and saboteurs

- it was difficult for the Republic to deal with these spies without resorting to fascistic surveillance and interrogation techniques
- this contrasted with how the Francoists dealth with spies, which gave the fascists an advantage

Played a major role in the eventual hand over to Franco

### Battle at Ebro

July - November 1938. The last big battle during the war

- Republic's last gamble
- three objectives:
    - protect Valencia from Franco
    - restore contact with Catalonia
    - demonstrate to the world that the Republican army was resilient (success - the Brits noticed the victory, and noticed how reliant Franco was on Italy and Germany)

Franco paid the Nazi's in mining rights. In exchange, they guaranteed his air superiority during the battle at Ebro

- This was a testing ground for Blitzkrieg tactics
- also for Soviet armored vehicles

the republicans retreated in November because of the Munich agreement

### The agreement

Britain and France signed a deal with Germany and Italy

- **It said that Hitler could invade Czechoslovakia**, which was the last functioning democracy in central eastern Europe
- this undermined Negrin's credibility and his resistance strategy

### POUM Trial

October 1938 (so duing the battle of Ebro) - POUM leaders publicly supported a rebellion

- the trial observed the constitutional process

### The downfall

Negrin knew that if he surrendured, Franco would not negotiate

- he planned on resisting

**Las of Political Responsibilities** law pushed by Franco in February 1939

- blanket repression, meant that there would be reprisals against Republican population
- retroactively punished people

Other republican and socialist leaders thought that they could negotiate pease with Franco, even though it was clear they couldn't

Armies surrendured to Franco in **March 1939**

Negrin had continued resisting because he believed that Britain and France would help Republican Spain

### Refugees

There were about 600k refugees trying to escape from Republican Spain at the end of the war
