Tech companies banned trump and his allies

### Problems with this

- lacked consistency and proportionality
- The internet's infrastructure should be neutral
- the people in control are few and unelected

### My thoughts on this

- makes sense to think of AWS as a utility
- Twitter functions as entertainment and it's engineered to capture attention, so I don't know if we should treat it as a utility
- On the other hand, itâ€™s a tool that's used lots of people, so it should be predictable. If you get kicked off, it should never be a surprise
