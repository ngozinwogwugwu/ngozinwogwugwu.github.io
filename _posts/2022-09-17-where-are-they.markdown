### The Great Filter

**The Great Filter** one or more *highly improbable *****evolutionary steps that would be required to produce an intelligent civilization that would be visible to us

This filter could be in our **future** or in our **past**

- if a Great Filter is in our future, we’ll probably never colonize the galaxy
- so we better hope the Great Filter is in our past

Note: the Great Filter could be in our future *and* our past

- Even if it’s behind us, we’ll probably be some sort of post-human by the time we colonize the galaxy

### A past Great Filter

If the Great Filter is in our past, then **we might be the only intelligent civilization in our galaxy. This would explain the absence of observable aliens**

If the great filter is in our past, that means it’s extremely unlikely that an Earth-like planet will produce a space-faring civilization

We can’t calculate how probable this is based on our understanding of evolutionary biology, but we can identify several possible Great Filters

- It took hundreds of millions of years between the formation of Earth and the first known life. This could be a great filter
- Another potential great filter: the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (this took 1.8 billion years)
- Some evolutionary transitions aren’t good candidates for great filters. Examples: flight, sight and photosynthesis all developed multiple times on Earth. This indicates that they’re not unlikely events

### A future Great Filter

There could also be a Great Filter that prevents civilizations that are at our level from progressing to the point where they colonize space

Nick Bostrom is defining an effective great filter as **an existential catastrophe**

It’s possible that there’s some destructive tendency common to almost all sufficiently advanced civilizations. And it would have to be *really* destructive and *really* probable

- if a civilization failed a thousand times before succeeding, they could have still arrived here millions of years ago
- some technological discovery could constitute a great filter

### Other possibilities

There might be aliens that we can’t detect. Bostrom thinks this is unlikely

- If aliens at this level exist, they would have expanded to us by now

Aliens might have decided not to colonize the universe. Bostrom thinks this is unlikely too

- there are resources in space
- all life on earth spreads whenever it can, so it would be reasonable to assume that alien life does too
- the civilization would have to never change its mind about non-expansion
- it only takes one. Even if nine alien races decide not to take over the galaxy, a tenth alien race might

### How might a species colonize space?

**Von Neumann probes** unmanned self-replicating spacecraft capable of interstellar travel

- named after **Jon von Neumann**
- if a probe were to travel at 1/10 the speed of light, aliens could colonize the galaxy within a couple million years
- this is very short in comparison to the amount of time it takes for life to evolve (billions of years)

### Life on Mars

We’re sending probes to Mars now. Bostrom hopes they don’t discover any signs of life

- if there was life on Mars, it’s more unlikely that the Great Filter was behind us
- the more complex the life we find, the less hope we have of colonizing the galaxy

We should still be investigating Mars. The more information we have, the better

### The Observation Selection Effect

Whether intelligent life is common or rare, every observer is guaranteed to find themselves

- this means that if Earth is the only place in the galaxy with intelligent life, it’s not a coincidence that we live here
