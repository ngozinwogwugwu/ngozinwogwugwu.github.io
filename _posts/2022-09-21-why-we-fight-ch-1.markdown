War is expensive. Rivals have incentives to bargain instead of going to war

- war is the exception, not the rule
- We see this same logic play out in other parts of life
    - labor strikes
    - court battles

**Thomas Schelling** Harvard economist, started applying this logic to wars between nations

So why do we still have wars? 

- **Unchecked interests**, when rulers don’t incur the costs of the war
- **Intangible incentives**, when a society is driven by values that are unrelated to profit
- **Uncertainty**, when rivals don’t fully understand their rival’s bargaining power
- **Commitment problems**, when the share of power between rivals changes
- **misperceptions**, because people aren’t always rational

### Case Study: Combos in Medellin

A **combo** is a street gang. They make a profit from the neighborhoods they control

- does drug retailing & protection rackets
- sets moneylending rates (takes a cut)
- sells licenses to sell staples

**Pachelly** and **El Mesa** are rival gangs in a neighborhood called **Bello**. They control prisons as well as neighborhoods

- After a bloody fight broke out in **Bellavista**, a prison in Medellin, the violence started spreading and the two gangs started gearing up for a war

**They decided to compromise** instead of going to war

- War is expensive. They would have lost revenue
- The majority of gang wars are negotiated away before they even start

### A closer look at the math

Thought experiment:

- Bello represents a $100 pie
- Pachelly and El Mesa are evenly matched, so they both have a 50% chance of winning a gang war
- let’s assume that the winner of the war would get all the winnings

War is costly. Although the Combo leaders don’t care about civilian casualties, the war hurts their bottom line

- let’s assume that a gang war destroys 20% of the pie
- now both gangs have a 50% chance of getting an $80 prize
- that’s an **expected prize of $40 if they go to war**

**bargaining range** the amount of territory that doesn’t get destroyed if no one goes to war

- this creates an incentive not to go to war

As long as both sides get more than $40, they’re getting more than their expected war prize

- crucially, **these incentives are transparent**. El Mesa knows Pachelly faces the same incentives as them
- Neither side fears an attack because they know they other side is incentivized to maintain the peace

Each side’s bargaining power comes from its ability to threaten the enemy

- as long as war is more costly for both sides, we can expect peace
- counterintuitive phenomenon: the more destructive our weapons, the easier it is to find peace
- throughout history, the more powerful our weapons got the less frequent the wars were (although when wars to happen, they’re doozies)

**Question:** *What if one of the rivals becomes weaker?*

- for example, what if the feds captures some of El Mesa’s leaders, so that their chance of winning falls to 20%

**Answer:** *El Mesa can expect to loose territory, but not go to war.* war is prevented by the Bargaining Range, as before, but the amount of the prize El Mesa can expect to get is diminished. 

- El Mesa’s expected winnings from a war would be $16 so anything more than that is good
- Pachelly’s expected winnings is $64, so anything more than that is good
