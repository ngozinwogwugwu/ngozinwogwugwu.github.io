**fungal hyphae** become a **mycelial network** using two key moves:
- branching
- fusing - must find other hyphae by **homing**

Hyphae need to know what they’re fusing with
- some fungi have tens of thousands of **mating types**
- sometimes hyphae fuse with their own mycelial network, but “self” here is not a binary

“Many fungi produce plant and animal hormones to alter the physiology of their associates”

### Predatory fungi

Some fungi eat **nematode worms**. They’ll only do this if:
- there’s not enough plant material to decompose
- the fungus senses a worm close by

The fungus produces worm-hunting organs, which **issue a chemical summons**

Some fungal tools:
- adhesive nets
- hyphal nooses - inflate when touched
- toxic hyphal stalks
- spores that find the worm

### Smells

Human smell: we can distinguish between a trillion odors
- plants, fungi and animals use similar receptors for detecting chemicals
- fungi don’t have noses - they use their whole bodies as one big nose
- **olfactory flashbacks** often include visual and emotional memories

“Male orchid bees collect scents from the world and amass them into a cocktail that they use to court females”

### truffles
**Piedmont white truffles** have never been domesticated
- exist as mycelial networks for most of the year
- the truffles produce spores
- Use smell to attract animals

Truffles must partner with trees, and the partner tree must consent
- some fungi will cause disease, while other relationships are symbiotic

Truffle mycelium sense their surroundings and responds unpredictably
**diversity dogs** are trained to find new types of truffles
Truffles may provide an incentive for people to leave forests alone
