Mycelial networks are **decentralized organisms**, made up of swarms of **interconnected hyphal tips**

- Hyphae are long, branched, and a single sell thick

How does one part of a mycelial network know what’s happening in a distant part of the network?

### How do fungi eat?

Fungi use Mycelium to feed - they embed themselves in their food, digest it externally, then absorb the nutrients

- food supplies are unpredictable, so the mycelium must be flexible (although growth patterns are not infinitely variable)
- Fungi can exert high pressures to get into food

### Facts about Hyphae

When Hyphae grow, they grow longer

- sometimes this process is so fast we can watch it
- this is in contrast to most multicellular organisms, which lay down new layers of cells

Life forms are *processes* and not *things*

- matter is constantly passing through living things

Mushrooms are collections of hyphae, inflated with water

- this is why mushrooms appear after rain
- This process can exert enough pressure to push through asphalt
- water must travel rapidly through a network in a *carefully directed pulse*

**Microtubules** dynamic filaments of protein, move substances across mycelial networks

- act as motors, so they can be energetically costly

### Fungi can perceive their world and act upon it

Most fungi can detect and respond to the following:

- light (direction, intensity and color)
    - fungi use **opsins**, the same light-sensitive pigment in rods and cones in our eyes
- temperature
- moisture, nutrients, toxins
- electrical fields

hyphae can integrate these data streams and take action

- they don’t have central brains. How do they do it?

**Max Delbruk** (biophysicist) - in the 1950s, he studied the perceptive ability of *Pycomyces blakesleeanus*

- *Pycomyces* can detect nearby objects, and we don’t know how

### Electrical signals in mycelial networks

**Stefan Olsson** Swedish mycologist - researches how mycelial networks coordinate

- Observed that signals spread through a *Panellus stipticus* network, but more quickly than chemicals can spread through the mycelium itself
- When he repeated the experiment with two separate networks, the signal didn’t spread between the two

Animals use electrical impulses to communicate information throughout our bodies - Olsson looked into whether communication systems exist for fungi as well

- used honey fungus (*Armillaria*), because it can stretch over kilometers and reach thousands of years in age
- Honey fungus fires impulses at a rate very similar to animal’s sensory neurons
- Olsson was able to replicate results with different types of fungus

### animal brains

Also complex networks of electrically excitable cells, but they differ from mycelial networks

- **synapses**, junctions where neurons connect, are not present in mycelial networks
- there could be other ways to regulate electrical impulses, though

### Fungal networks and Biocomputing

Biocomputing is already a field

- slime molds can act as sensors and computers
- mycelial networks are more convenient for computing

**Andrew Adamatzky** director of the Unconventional Computing Laboratory

- Observed spontaneous waves of electrical activity in oyster mushrooms
- published a paper called “Towards fungal computer” where he proposed that mycelial networks could compute information

fungal reactions are slower than silicon ones, but  Adamatzky thinks we can use mycelium as “large-scale environmental sensor[s]”

- fungal networks already monitor lots of data streams, and we could use that to learn more about ecosystems

### defining intelligence

Traditional definitions of intelligence require a brain or a mind, since we define it by studying humans

- **Daniel Dennett** dismisses this requirement as an “archaic myth”
- **Charles Darwin**: “Intelligence is based on how efficient a species becomes at doing the things they need to survive”

**Swarm intelligence** describes problem solving behavior of brainless systems

Our brains are filled with neurons that don’t know what our thoughts are

Animals can do a lot without brains

- If you train a flatworm to do something and cut off its head, it will grow a new head. Moreover, the new head will act on the original’s training

Octopuses have nerves distributed throughout their bodies

- lots of nerves are in the tentacles
