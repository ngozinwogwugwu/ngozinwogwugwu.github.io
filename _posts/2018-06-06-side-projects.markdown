## NwoDB
I wanted to learn more about databases, so I made one.

Going off of [Connor Stack](https://github.com/cstack)'s tutorial, [Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/), I decided to make my own. I followed along with Stack's tutorial using C, then I recreated the functionality in Python.

If you want to see my code or try it for yourself, go [here](https://github.com/ngozinwogwugwu/nwodb).

## Quick Hits
I compiled some of the smaller one-off projects that I've made onto one page
- **Markdown Viewer**: let's you see the results of your markdown text in real time
- **SQLite Header Viewer**: displays the header of a SQLite file, as defined in the [ChiDB course](http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chidb/fileformat.html#file-header)
- **Coffee Clicker**: helps you decide what kind of coffee to get
- **Scooter Table**: displays a real-time list of Coup scooters in Berlin

## RC-Robot
I paired with [another RC-er](https://github.com/tvieregge/) to build [RC-Robot](https://github.com/tvieregge/rc-robot), the robot that tries to follow you around.
