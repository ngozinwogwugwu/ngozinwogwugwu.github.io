If I build a home, I want to include skylights in spaces that are generally neglected.

# In the Bathroom

Showering in sunlight is the way to go. The master bathroom in this condo in Venice, LA, included a full skylight

This bath in Honolulu is situated underneath the veranda. Along with the regular veranda tiles, there are a few frosted glass ones.

# In hallways

The house in Honolulu used the same technique to light hallways. Even in spaces that didn't get direct sunlight benefited from lights being on upstairs
