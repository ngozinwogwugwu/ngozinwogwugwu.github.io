<p>I wanted to review computer science fundametals during quarentine, so I took an <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1">algorithms course</a>. I decided to do my homework using Python rather than Java, and I published my work <a href="https://github.com/ngozinwogwugwu/exercises/tree/master/data_structures_homeworks">here</a></p>

<p>The homework I had the most fun with was <a href="https://github.com/ngozinwogwugwu/exercises/tree/master/data_structures_homeworks/percolation">percolation</a></p>

<h1 id="percolation">Percolation</h1>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ngozinwogwugwu/exercises/blob/master/data_structures_homeworks/percolation/percolation_animation.png" alt="percolation animation" /></p>

<p>I model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation">percolation</a> here using an <em>n</em> by <em>n</em> grid. The grid percolates if there is a path from the top to the bottom through open nodes.</p>

<p>The goal is to use a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the value <em>p</em>, which represents the ratio of open nodes to total nodes in the system where we can expect the system to percolate.</p>
