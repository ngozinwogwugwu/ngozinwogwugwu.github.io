<hr />

<h2 id="sviatlana-tsikhanouskaya">Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya</h2>

<p>Probably won the 2020 presidential election in <strong>Belarus</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Immediately afterward, <strong>Alexander Lukashenko</strong> forced her out of the country</li>
  <li>Her husband, <strong>Siarhei Tskhanouski</strong>, is imprisoned in Belarus</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-campaign">the campaign</h3>

<p>Siarhei ran for president because he was <strong>frustrated with bureucracy and corruption</strong>. The regime ended his campaign and imprisoned him. Sviatlana ran in his place</p>

<ul>
  <li>the campaign was about ordinary people standing up to the regime</li>
  <li>two prominent opposition polititions endorsed her campaign (their campaigns were blocked)</li>
  <li>She continued dispite death threats</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="results-of-the-election">Results of the election</h3>

<p>officials announced that Lukashenko won 80% of the vote (no one believed this). Right afterward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the internet was cut off</li>
  <li>Sviatlana was detained by police and forced out of the country</li>
  <li>Mass demonstrations across Belarus</li>
</ul>

<p>Sviatlana thought that the regime would give way to pressure, but it didn’t</p>

<h3 id="sviatlana-in-the-eu">Sviatlana in the EU</h3>

<p>she wants to <strong>pressure the regime</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>sanctions, democratic unity</li>
  <li>anything that makes it expensive for Lukashenko to stay in power</li>
</ul>

<p>She met with <strong>Merkel, Macron and Biden. They broadened sanctions</strong> on Belarus</p>

<p>Stayed in Lithuania, which was proud to host her dispite the trouble at the Border</p>

<p>She now has the entire free world backing her, but it’s not enough to</p>

<h2 id="lukashenkos-rescue-package">Lukashenko’s rescue package</h2>

<p>When protests first broke out after the election, he didn’t have a plan, but he got help from Moscow</p>

<p><strong>FSB: Russian security services</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>flew from Moscow to Minsk - helped Lukashenko quell the dissent</li>
  <li>shift to a more sophisticated, more controlled way to repress the population</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Russian television journalists</strong> replaced some Belarusian journalists</p>

<ul>
  <li>portrayed demonstrations as the work of America</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Russian police</strong> supplemented Belarusian police</p>

<ul>
  <li>mass arrests are unnecessary if you can jail, torture or murder the right people</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Russian companies</strong> offered markets for Belarusian products that had been banned in the democratic west</p>

<p>This rescue package was very similar to the one Putin sent Bashar al-Assad in Syria six years earlier</p>

<h3 id="why-did-putin-do-this">Why did Putin do this?</h3>

<p>the Arab Spring (and the fall of the Berlin wall) made it clear that <strong>democratic revolutions are contagious</strong></p>

<p><strong>regime change means death, imprisonment or exile</strong> in an authoritarian country</p>

<p>If Putin can influence Belarus to remain authoritarian, regime change in Russia is less likely</p>

<h3 id="lukashenkos-brazen--illegal-actions"><strong>Lukashenko’s</strong> brazen &amp; illegal actions</h3>

<p>he’s active as if he was untouchable</p>

<ul>
  <li>In May 2021, Belarusian air traffic control <strong>forced an Irish passenger plane to land</strong> in Minsk
    <ul>
      <li>this was in order to <strong>arrest Roman Protasevich</strong>, a young exiled dissident</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In August, <strong>Vitaly Shishov was hanged</strong> in Kyiv park</li>
  <li>Lukashenko’s regime tried to destabalize its EU neighbors by <strong>forcing streams of refugees across their borders</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>lured</strong> Afghan and Iraqi <strong>refugees to Minsk</strong> with tourist visas</li>
      <li><strong>Forced them across the borders</strong> of Lithuania, Latvia and Poland <strong>at gunpoint</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="networks-of-despots">Networks of despots</h1>

<p><strong>Modern autocracies</strong> are not run by one bad guy. They’re <strong>run by sophisticated networks</strong> of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>kleptocratic financial structures</li>
  <li>security services (police, surveillance, military)</li>
  <li>propagandists</li>
</ul>

<p>These networks are often <strong>international and do not have a unifying ideology.</strong> There is no leader and they’re connected by economic deals</p>

<ul>
  <li>this eases the pressure sanctions and makes everyone rich</li>
</ul>

<p>In theory, Belarus is an international pariah. In practice, it’s a member of Autocracy Inc</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>China</strong> is working on a large development project there</li>
  <li><strong>Iran</strong> has expanded its relationship with Belarus</li>
  <li><strong>Cuba</strong>n officials have called for an end to “foreign interference”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Venezuela</strong> is in a similar position. The United States, Canada, the EU and many of its neighbors have <strong>sanctions</strong> against it. <strong>Millions of people protest</strong> in the streets</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Russia and China</strong> invest in Marudo’s Regime</li>
  <li><strong>Turkey</strong> helps with an illicit gold trade</li>
  <li><strong>Cuba</strong> provides security advisors and technology</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If Venezuela’s regime were acting alone, it would fall</strong>, but it’s receiving <strong>help from other autocracies</strong></p>

<h3 id="impervious-to-criticism">Impervious to Criticism</h3>

<p>The leaders of the Soviet Union cared deeply about how the world perceived them, but today <strong>autocracies don’t care about criticism</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>this enables them to use aggressive tactics against mass protests</li>
</ul>

<p>the <strong>Maduro Model</strong> of governence means that autocrats are willing to pay the price of becoming a totally failed country</p>

<ul>
  <li>means economic collaps, isolation and mass poverty</li>
  <li>but the autocrat stays in power</li>
  <li>might be what’s in store for Belarus</li>
  <li>The west won’t provide money, so they depend on China, Pakistan, Russia and Saudi Arabia</li>
</ul>

<p>This might explain the <strong>pathetic reaction to the fall of Kabul</strong></p>

<h1 id="uyghurs">Uyghurs</h1>

<p>50,000 exiled Uyghers live in Turkey. In another era, these exiles would have sympathy from the Turkish government</p>

<ul>
  <li>in 2009, <strong>Erdogan called Chinese repression of Uyghurs a genocide</strong></li>
  <li>He has strengthened ties with China since becoming president</li>
  <li>recently, the Turkish government has surveilled and detained Uyghurs on bogus terrorism charges. Deported some to China</li>
</ul>

<p>In late 2020, a delayed shipment of covid vaccines from China looked suspiciously like a ransom for Uyghur extridition, even though both governments deny it</p>

<h3 id="surprisingly-muslim-countries-are-turning-a-blind-eye-to-uyghurs-in-china">Surprisingly, Muslim countries are turning a blind eye to Uyghurs in China</h3>

<p>Pakistani Primi Minister accepts the Chinese version of events</p>

<p>Saudis, Emiratis and Egyptians have all arrested and deported Uyghurs</p>

<ul>
  <li>all these countries have purchased Chinese surveillance technology</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s as if these countries agree to accept China’s action on Hong Kong, Tibet, Uygurs and human rights in exchange for investment and equipment</p>

<h1 id="it-happened-here">It happened here</h1>

<p>We didn’t learn much after 2016 Russian election interference</p>

<h3 id="the-united-front"><strong>The United Front</strong></h3>

<p>an influence projet for the CCP. Meant to shape global opinion about china</p>

<ul>
  <li>faculty in American universities tried to shape academic debates in China’s favor. This was in the context of calligraphy courses</li>
</ul>

<p>Chinese democracy activists <em>in America</em> are harrased by Chinese agents</p>

<ul>
  <li>some have had strange car accidents</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="american-industry">American Industry</h3>

<p>lots of personal, financial, business links to China and Russia</p>

<p>Hollywood and sports appeal to CCP</p>

<h1 id="liberal-democracy-vs-authoritarianism-around-the-world">Liberal Democracy vs Authoritarianism around the world</h1>

<p><strong>Srdja Popovic</strong> democracy activist</p>

<ul>
  <li>says democratic movements are becoming better organized</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="were-not-doing-too-well">We’re not doing too well</h3>

<p>The diplomatic tools we used to use against autocrats don’t work anymore</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sanctions don’t have the same impact</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Democracy assistance</strong> America spends money on this, but it’s not a lot in comparison to what the Authoritarian leaders will spend</p>

<ul>
  <li>We still have American foreign-language broadcasters</li>
</ul>

<p>Russia spends billions on state media, seen all over Europe</p>

<p>China spends billions on media globally</p>

<p>We don’t have an answer to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the silk road initiative</li>
  <li>the United Front</li>
  <li>Russian disinformation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="actions-to-take-today">Actions to take today</h3>

<p>Biden hosted a <strong>summit for democracy</strong> Dec 9-10 (<a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/12/06/joe-bidens-summit-for-democracy-is-not-all-that-democratic">The Economist focused more on who was invited than the content</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li>means very little</li>
</ul>

<p>Real actions we should take:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shut down tax havens, enforce money-laundering laws</li>
  <li>Stop selling surveillance tech to autocracies</li>
  <li>Divest from vicious regimes</li>
  <li>figure out how to respond when autocracies commit crimes outside their borders</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-americas-doing-now">How America’s doing now</h3>

<p>Our actions on the global stage have been declining. So has global respect for American democracy</p>

<p><strong>Trump</strong> seems okay with global autocracy, and he eroded rules and norms that strengthen democracy in the United States</p>

<p><strong>The American left</strong> has become dissolusioned with democracy at home</p>

<ul>
  <li>focused on America’s problems, convinced that democracy doesn’t work, or that it’s not working here</li>
  <li>When protesters in Hong Kong asked for help, American activists didn’t do much</li>
</ul>
