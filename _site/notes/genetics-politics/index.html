<hr />

<p><strong>Kathryn Paige Harden</strong> works in the field of behavior genetics</p>

<ul>
  <li>psych professor, University of Texas at Austin</li>
  <li>mentored by Eric Turkheimer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>behavior genetics</strong> investigates influence of genes on <strong>character traits</strong> and <strong>life outcomes</strong></p>

<h3 id="pushback-from-hardens-colleagues">pushback from Harden’s colleagues</h3>

<p>there’s a possible link between behavior genetics and eugenics</p>

<ul>
  <li>Harden was ostracized by her liberal colleagues for her work</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>polygenic score</strong> a weighted sum of an individuals relevant genetic variants</p>

<ul>
  <li>Harden shared <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797616643070">a paper</a> that used polygenic score to explain population variance</li>
  <li>the paper emphasized that it’s difficult to distinguish between genetic and environmental effects on social outcomes</li>
  <li>There was a lot of pushback to this paper. professor of public policy at Duke: “there will be no reason to pursue these types of research programs at all, and they can be rendered to the same location as Holocaust denial research”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Bell Curve</strong>, Charles Murray &amp; Richard Herrnstein - includes claims about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>genetic basis for racial hierarchy in intelligence</li>
  <li>genetic foundation for poverty and inequality</li>
  <li>Harden’s colleagues compared the paper she shared to the bell curve</li>
</ul>

<p>they considered refusing to fund research into effects of genes on behavior or social outcomes</p>

<p>We can’t commit to egalitarianism by declaring genetic uniformity</p>

<p><strong>The left isn’t talking about this, so the only voices are on the right</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“red pill” claims to expose liberal hypocrisy</li>
  <li>Harden is trying to fight back</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Genetic Lottery: Why DNA Matters for Social Equality</strong> - Harden’s new book</p>

<h3 id="behavioralism-vs-determinism"><strong>behavioralism vs determinism</strong></h3>

<p><strong>behavioralism</strong> - claims that environmental manipulation can produce any desired outcome</p>

<ul>
  <li>aligns with postwar liberal principles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Much_Can_We_Boost_IQ_and_Scholastic_Achievement%3F">How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?</a></strong> - 1969 article</p>

<ul>
  <li>argued that there was an IQ gap between races in America, and the reason was at least partly genetic</li>
  <li>argued that policy interventions were unlikely shift this hierarchy</li>
  <li>Got a lot of criticism</li>
</ul>

<p>IQ is flexible</p>

<ul>
  <li>Poor children gain IQ after wealthy families adopt them</li>
  <li>populations gain IQ over time</li>
</ul>

<p>Just because outcomes are partly genetic doesn’t mean they’re inevitable</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/1997-turkheimer.pdf"><strong>The Search for a Psychometric left</strong></a> - Terkheimer argued that the left has nothing to fear from genes</p>

<ul>
  <li>We don’t need to deny heritability to oppose determinism, reductionism and racism</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-limits-of-behavior-genetics">the limits of behavior genetics</h3>

<p>Some studies found genes for aggression, depression, homosexuality, but <strong>the studies couldn’t be replicated</strong></p>

<p>Complex traits are governed by multiple genes</p>

<p><strong>genome-wide association study</strong> (GWAS)- attempt to identify thousands of places in the genome where DNA differences correlate to traits/outcomes</p>

<ul>
  <li>can predict population variance for height, weight and some diseases</li>
  <li>can predict some complex behavioral traits</li>
</ul>

<p>A GWA for educational attainment found ~1300 sites on the genome that correlate with scholastic success</p>

<ul>
  <li>individual sites have a negligible predictive ability, but the sum is very predictive</li>
  <li>people with the highest scores are 5x more likely to graduate from college</li>
</ul>

<p>GWAS show correlation, but not causation</p>

<ul>
  <li>depend on populations within a specific society</li>
  <li>results are not portable - results from the UK will not tell you anything about populations in Estonia</li>
  <li>not a good predictor for individuals</li>
</ul>

<p>GWAS reveal a lot much about geography and culture</p>

<ul>
  <li>example: you could conduct a GWAS for chopstick use. It would tell you more about culture than individual’s dexterity</li>
  <li>possible solution: compare GWAS results within families</li>
</ul>

<p>Social outcomes also depend on plenty of factors (conscientiousness, risk-aversion, physical features…)</p>

<p><strong>Harden thinks we’ll be stuck forever if we consider this question to have a binary answer</strong></p>

<p>One benefit of GWAS: they help you account for genetic differences when trying to do studies on environmental factors</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parents have significant impact on environmental effects, even if they don’t pass on all of their genes</li>
</ul>

<p>Another benefit: We can see how treatments interact with genetics</p>

<h3 id="clash-with-sam-harris">Clash with Sam Harris</h3>

<p>Sam Harris had Charles Murray on as a guest in April 2017</p>

<ul>
  <li>they said that people don’t want to hear that IQ differs across ethnic groups</li>
  <li>Harris mostly had him on because he’d been caught up in the culture war</li>
</ul>

<p>Harden and Turkheimer wrote a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/5/18/15655638/charles-murray-race-iq-sam-harris-science-free-speech">piece for vox</a> meant to confront Harris’ podcast</p>

<ul>
  <li>They had to make a nuanced argument to separate the truths from the falsehoods in the podcast</li>
  <li>We can’t deny that genetics have an impact on human academic scores</li>
  <li>However there’s <strong>no reason to think that racial IQ gaps are anything but the result of racism</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Harris eventually had Harden on his podcast. It was actually pretty awkward</p>

<h3 id="blowback-from-the-left">blowback from the left</h3>

<p>There are more voices on the left that are trying to acknowledge inherited intelligence</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>the cult of smart</strong> asserts that improving the education system won’t help until we acknowledge that some students are just smarter than others</li>
</ul>

<p>Harden is getting dragged on twitter</p>

<p><strong>Dorothy Roberts</strong> professor of law, sociology, Africana studies - responded to a 2018 Op-Ed that Harden wrote in the NYT, which said we should use genetics to inform education policy</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There’s no way that genetic testing is going to lead to a restructuring of society in a just way in the future. <strong>We have a hundred years of evidence for what happens when social outcomes are attributed to genetic differences</strong>, and it is always to stigmatize, control and punish the people predicted to have socially devalued traits”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is a push from the right to pay more attention to genetics</p>

<ul>
  <li>blueprint says that polygenic scores should be understood as “fortune tellers”, and white supremacists love it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-genetic-lottery">The genetic lottery</h3>

<p>assersions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>just because we value some traits more than others doesn’t mean we value some people more than others</li>
  <li>We should view inherent qualities as something you were lucky to get</li>
  <li>We should get better at separating the questions of nature and nurture</li>
  <li>If we don’t acknowledge how genes played a part in our success, we assume that we did it all through hard work</li>
  <li>If genes play a significant role in our success, maybe we shouldn’t design our society so that you need a college degree to get health care</li>
</ul>
