It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chidb/index.html&quot;&gt;chidb&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m giving it a try. I’ve been using relational databases for years, but chidb has been a great way for me to view database management systems as something other than a black box. Bonus: This’ll help me get acquainted with C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chidb-quickstart&quot;&gt;Chidb Quickstart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One drawback to this online course is that there’s not a lot of guidance. This means that it took me a couple days to get set up. If you want to give chidb a try, and you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; want to spend a couple days getting setup, try using my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ngozinwogwugwu/chidb_quickstart&quot;&gt;chidb quickstart repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you clone it and follow the steps in the readme, you’ll have a working docker container with a chidb bind mount in about five minutes. This means that you’ll be able to make changes to the chidb repo on your own machine, and use a docker container to install and run it. My favorite part about this is that you won’t need to install any mystery software on your own machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sqlite-header-viewer&quot;&gt;SQLite Header Viewer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting though the unit tests for &lt;a href=&quot;http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chidb/assignment_btree.html#step-1-opening-a-chidb-file&quot;&gt;Assignment 1, Step 1&lt;/a&gt; takes quite a bit of time if you’re starting from scratch. If you want to view the SQLite headers that chidb uses for the unit tests, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/hexdump.1.html&quot;&gt;hexdump&lt;/a&gt;, or you can try out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngozinwogwugwu.github.io/mini_frontend_projects/&quot;&gt;SQLite Header Viewer&lt;/a&gt;, which will tell you exactly what is wrong with a corrupted SQLite header&lt;/p&gt;

Hackathon</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/projects/hackathon/2019/04/27/recurse-center-south-hackathon.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recurse Center S.O.U.T.H. Hackathon" /><published>2019-04-27T16:07:43-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-27T16:07:43-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/projects/hackathon/2019/04/27/recurse-center-south-hackathon</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/projects/hackathon/2019/04/27/recurse-center-south-hackathon.html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve participated in hackathons before, but S.O.U.T.H was the first hackathon where I acted as a participant and a planner. Because the theme was “silly projects”, I ended up making &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngozinwogwugwu.github.io/postweather/&quot;&gt;Postweather&lt;/a&gt;: the weather app that says you should have brought an umbrella yesterday, because it rained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the project, I learned how easy it is to overestimate what I can do in eight hours, and I found a few tools that I want to try using&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;organizing-the-hackathon&quot;&gt;Organizing the Hackathon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I participated in organizing with ten other recursers, and it was a real team effort. We needed to reserve space, order food, advertize and execute the event, and plan a demonstration session. I was in charge of zulip communication, and I led a pre-hackathon git discussion, so that hackathon participants could collaborate more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending organizational meetings made it clear to me how much thought and work goes into events like this. We mainly emphasized removing barriers to participation and using a “silly event” as a chance to learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ideation&quot;&gt;Ideation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our pre-hackathon ideation session mirrored an improv class: we tried to be as silly and spontaneous as possible. I paired with a new person every thirty seconds and tried to find clever ways to turn useful tools into useless technology. We spent most of our time laughing at our ideas, and it was quite freeing to remove the pressure of coming up with that “million dollar idea”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;initial-project-idea&quot;&gt;Initial Project Idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the idea of a “post weather app” from another participant because it made me laugh the hardest. Imagine an app that pings you &lt;em&gt;the day after&lt;/em&gt; it rains, to sanctimoniously tell you that you really should have remembered your umbrella yesterday. Pretty useless, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to deploy a full stack application, since I had never done that before. I chose a combination of React and Django, because I knew that I could start an app quickly. I also wanted to see if I could send actual texts to my users, so I looked into &lt;a href=&quot;twilio.com&quot;&gt;twilio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trimming-down-the-project&quot;&gt;Trimming down the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the day, I realized that I had been a little too ambitious. Although I was able to build &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngozinwogwugwu.github.io/postweather/&quot;&gt;a quick frontend&lt;/a&gt;, I was struggling to connect it to my Django app, and I was nowhere close to deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using the frontend as only a signup page, I moved all of my functionality to the frontend. A user gets their useless, annoying lecture the moment they enter their zip code, rather than first thing the morning after&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-goals&quot;&gt;Future goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have ambitions to deploy a Django app, especially one with text functionality. That way I can play with twillio and feel confident about my ability to deploy a project&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve participated in hackathons before, but S.O.U.T.H was the first hackathon where I acted as a participant and a planner.
