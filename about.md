Hi! I'm Ngozi

I have been working as a programmer since graduating from [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/eng/), and I'm currently participating in a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). I'm using my time here to improve as a programmer and explore different aspects of engineering, like machine learning, robotics and databases.

Outside of programming, I'm an avid [reader](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/39266582-nwogwugwu?shelf=read&sort=date_added), and I'm learning to play the [koto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koto_(instrument)).
