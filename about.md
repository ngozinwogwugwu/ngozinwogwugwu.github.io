Hi! I'm Ngozi.

I have been working as a programmer since graduating from Boston University, and I'm currently participating in a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). I'm using my time here to improve as a programmer and explore different fields of engineering, like machine learning, robotics and databases.
