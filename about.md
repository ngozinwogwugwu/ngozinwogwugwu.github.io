Hi! I'm Ngozi.

I work as a software engineer, based out of New York.

Outside of work, I'm an avid [reader](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/39266582-nwogwugwu?shelf=read&sort=date_added) and I play the [koto](/assets/hobbies/ngozi_koto.jpeg). I enjoy playing [go](https://online-go.com/player/706985/) occationally, so feel free to challenge me online. I learned how to [surf](/assets/hobbies/surf_win.JPG) during the pandemic, which involved a lot of [wipeouts](/assets/hobbies/surf_fail.JPG).
